# TCA-Templates
My own Xcode Templates for The Composable Architecture(TCA)

# Installation
These can be added to your Xcode by moving the **Custom Templates** folder into ~Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/. 
If you don't see **Templates** folder, create it.

# How to use
In a Xcode Project select File>New>File from there scroll down and you should see Custom Templates you just added.

# Templates

## SwiftUI
- TCA Reducer+UI (two files, one with UI, another one with State, Action, Environment and Reducer)
- TCA Separate files (each struct in separate file)
- TCA (everything in one file)

## UIKit
- TCA ViewController (only view controller)
- UIKit TCA (TCA for UIKit)
